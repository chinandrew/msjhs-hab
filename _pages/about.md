This is the homepage for the Mission San Jose High School High Altitude Balloon Project.  

Our mission is to teach climate science, programming, and data analysis to students by engineering and launching high altitude weather balloons. Students are involved in planning the launches, programming sensors for the payload, and analyzing data once it returns. 

We are run by Dr. Charles Brucker, a geometry and AP computer science teacher, and various students and alumni. For more information on our launches, visit the [Flights]({{ "/flights/" | relative_url }}) page. For questions, contact *email*


## What is a High Altitude Balloon?  
A high altitude balloon (HAB) is a specialized balloon designed to carry payloads into the stratosphere. These balloons can reach altitudes of over 100,000 ft (30,480 m), and are often used for carrying weather instruments to measure atmospheric properties at various altitudes. The balloons are filled with a lifting gas to ascend into the atmosphere, withstanding high winds and low temperatures. As they rise, the balloons expand due to the decreasing exterior pressure. Eventually, the balloon expands enough that it bursts, and the payload will fall to the ground on a parachute. The payload contains a tracking device so it can be recovered.

Other organizations that launch HABs for educational purposes can be found at the following links.
