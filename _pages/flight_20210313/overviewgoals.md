As the first flight in this project, we wanted to make something impactful to students while not overextending ourselves. We had ambitious ideas on how we could determine what experiments were flown and how we could structure the programming assignments, but ultimately decided that a more simple and structured approach to have a solid first launch made the most sense.

At a high level, our goals for this flight were the following:  
a. In conjunction with existing climate science assignments, provide students with a better understanding of the greenhouse effect and other atmospheric phenomena.  
b. Provide students with the opportunity to learn about programming hardware and analyzing data in a real application.  
c. Maximize the number of students we could get involved.  
d. Design something extensible and reusable with low marginal cost.  


*NOTE: Due to COVID-19, we unfortunately decided not to involve students with the hardware engineering. There are many interesting learning opportunities involved with it, so this is something we'd like to do in the future.*

We would come up with a list of interesting questions or experiments, the sensors required to answer them, and assign student groups to program the sensors. Once the data was retrieved, students would analyse and interpret the data. These technical tasks would achieve goal (b). Our experiments would mostly be climate related to achieve goal (a). For example, observing the tropopause temperature inversion or measuring the concentration of CO2. While we would not fly enough sensors for all students to be involved, all students would participate in data analysis, achieving goal (c). With the exception of the balloon and lifting gas, all our hardware would be reusable for future launches as long as we recovered the balloon, achieving goal (d).

For more detailed descriptions of the student assignments, see the [Student Activites]({{ "/flight20210313/sensordevelopment/" | relative_url }}) section. As we went through this whole project, we ended up finding many more interesting opportunities for learning, which will be described further in the [Takeaways - Student Activies]({{ "/flight20210313/studentactivitytakeaways/" | relative_url }}) section.
