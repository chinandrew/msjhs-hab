To recover the payloads, tracking devices are required. Our past launches used either a commercial GPS tracker or a cell phone to provide location data for balloon recovery. We had nearly lost a cell phone based balloon in the past since the cell phone requires signal to transmit and it landed in the middle of a rural area with spotty cell coverage. Since we were planning a similar rural landing area (see [Flight and Recovery - Launch Planning]({{ "/flight20210313/launchplanning/" | relative_url }})), we had concerns with using a cell phone. While cell coverage has improved drastically in the last decade, we had good experiences using a SPOT satellite tracker and felt it would still be more reliable. NOTE: Both cell and GPS trackers are unable to transmit above certain heights due to various regulations, so expect tracking to cut out after launch and only come back once the balloons are landed.

SPOT trackers are often used by backcountry travellers in case of emergencies, and rely on satellite communication to transmit their location. They require a service plan to use, similar to a cell plan, and once enabled will transmit their location at adjustable intervals. SPOT provides a web interface for viewing the current location.

One drawback of these trackers is they do not work as well while at high speeds or in incorrect orientations, so little to no information may be transmitted during the flight itself, and unfortunate landings may affect its ability to transmit effectively. While we were able to successfully recover our payload, we encountered both these problems. See the [Postmortem and Takeaways - Technical Failures]({{ "/flight20210313/technicalfailures/" | relative_url }}) section for more details.
