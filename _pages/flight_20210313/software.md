Software for all the sensors was an assignment for students (see [Student Activities - Sensor Development]({{ "/flight20210313/sensordevelopment/" | relative_url }}) section for more information) which will be used for future classes, and as such is not published. However, many tutorials and examples are available online which students were encouraged to take advantage of. Relevant tutorials for the Arduinos and sensors flown are included below.
