Upon each student group submitting their code, we would test that it ran and stored data, fixing any minor issues if needed.

Before the launch date, we also assembled the box and sensors as if it was the real thing and conducted a dry run. We drove it around to test the tracking and left it running for over the duration of the flight. During this dry run, only the CO2 sensor failed to record data. We were unable to pinpoint the cause of the failure, but a second test ran without issue and we decided to fly it as-is. During the actual flight, the sensor recorded successfully.
