We used an online calculator to estimate the required balloon size and lifting gas volume for an estimated burst altitude of 100000 ft, which we chose because it was a nice sounding number to hit. Various online calculators exist to calculate the required lift gas volume and balloon size for a given payload and desired flight profile.

We primarily used <http://habhub.org/calc/> and cross referenced against other calculators to sanity check. The balloon inflation process is not extremely precise, and an over or underinflated balloon will have different flight characteristics, so all estimates were taken as rough guidelines. We used a [chart](https://the-rocketman.com/recovery-html/) from the parachute manufacturer to determine the parachute diameter. Our final setup was the Kaymont 1kg balloon with hydrogen and Rocketman 4 foot parachute.

The load cell sensor, intended to weigh the payload, was attached to the top of the container. It was connected to the parachute with 5m of 50lb fishing line, and the parachute was connected to the balloon with another 5m of line.
