In addition to sensor development, one group of students decided to work on a website that could be used to document this project and share data, figures, and media. This assignment was evaluated separately from the others. The website development group handled the design, development, and hosting of the site, and met with us to discuss the content and requirements.

We had many discussions on how we wanted to approach the website group. We knew that we wanted to have an online presence to showcase the flight, but didn’t know if we wanted students to create it or if we would host it ourselves. The upsides for a student created website would be an excellent learning opportunity in web development, but we weren’t sure how we would handle maintaining the site year over year since we didn’t want to restrict future groups to using the work of past students. While the website process is still ongoing and we will certainly make changes in the future, our current plan is to have one central website that we host which will link out to all the student websites. This means that each year would develop their own website, multiple groups could develop multiple websites if needed, and there is still one central place someone can go to to see all the launches.
