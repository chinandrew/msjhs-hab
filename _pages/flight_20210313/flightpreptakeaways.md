In general, preparation and execution of the launch went well. Weather was favorable, and both launch and landing site selection went smoothly. Since it was easier for us to overinflate than underinflate the balloon, having a trajectory that allowed for shorter flights gave us a larger margin of error. That being said, there is much room for improvement for the inflation process. Targeting 200 grams of lift, we had 150 grams of weight to the box and stopped inflation once the box began to lift, and we probably could have used less weight since the inflation tube was still attached.

Our preflight checks worked and all failures were to unforeseen circumstances, but we still believe a more rigorous preflight check system would be useful. Not only would the added discipline lend itself to more consistently successful launches, but additional redundancy measures we plan to add would increase the complexity of preflight testing.
