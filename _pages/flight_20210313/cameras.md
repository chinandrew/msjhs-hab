We primarily wanted to fly a still camera, since we felt that high resolution stills would be a better outcome than a video. However, since action camera technology has made them small and relatively cheap, we were able to fly one to capture video.

Our stills camera was the Panasonic ZS100, which fulfilled the following requirements:
Intervalometer support: Our previous launches had used a basic Canon point and shoot with Canon Hack Development Kit firmware to achieve this, but the ZS100 has one built in.
External battery support: We had previously used a AA battery camera and jerry rigged an external battery pack, but were able to find a dummy battery pack DC coupler for the ZS100.
(Relatively) cheap: We bought one used in excellent condition for $250.

The camera also had RAW image support, which was not required but desirable. We set the camera to the Program Mode and the focus manually set to infinity. The intervalometer was set to 7 seconds due to memory capacity.

The video camera was a random, well reviewed action camera from Amazon. Though it supported 4k/30fps, we had it film at 1080p/60fps since we thought the higher shutter speed might be more beneficial for a swinging box.

For the action camera, a 5 hour recording took 8.5GB. For the stills camera, each photo (JPEG+RAW) was 30mb, and we took a photo every 7 seconds, meaning weâ€™d use roughly 15GB each hour. Factoring in the box assembly time pre launch and any underestimations on flight time, the 128GB SD cards we used for each camera would be more than enough.
