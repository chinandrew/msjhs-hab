Our launch date was selected many weeks beforehand, though weather was uncertain until the week before. Every day until the launch, we checked forecasts and ran simulations for predicted flight paths. The landing site was targeted as somewhere in Central California. We knew the landing site variability was extremely high, and we wanted to land in a low population, easily accessible area. HAB payloads can get stuck in trees, fall into the ocean, or end up in other difficult to retrieve places, and maximizing the chances of recovery are important. The vast fields and farmland of Central California were perfect for this. We would adjust our launch site based on where we could achieve the desired landing site, which ended up being in Modesto.

We primarily used two flight prediction tools: <https://predict.habhub.org/>, and <http://astra-planner.soton.ac.uk/>. As launch day approached, habhub provided some odd looking trajectories that didnâ€™t agree with ASTRA planner. However, both calculators showed landing sites within the desired area, which gave us confidence. We also used <https://www.stratoflights.com/en/tutorial/predicting-the-flight-path/>, and found it gave nearly identical predictions to ASTRA, which made us weigh that prediction more heavily. 

The two predicted flight paths are displayed below. Note the extremely odd flight path predicted by ASTRA (second image), which led us to favor the habhub prediction (first image).

The flight ended up being shorter than anticipated due to a slight overfill of the balloon, and the landing site just southwest of Fresno suggested that the habhub estimate was more accurate.
