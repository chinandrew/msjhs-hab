*NOTE: No students were present for the launch, masks were worn at all times, and of the four people at the launch, two were vaccinated and the other two were brothers who had been self isolated.*

We launched on March 13, 2021 from Fairview Park in Modesto. We had selected 11AM as the launch time and began preparing at 10:15AM. We had estimated it would take 45 minutes to prepare the launch, but it ended up being just over an hour, with the launch occurring at 11:25AM.

The payload had been assembled the night before, so all that was left was to power it on and verify everything was recording. For the first launch, we had an informal preflight checklist that we conducted to make sure everything was operational. While it worked well and our eventual technical failures were due to unforeseen circumstances, we decided that future launches should use a more structured checklist to be more rigorous. Our most up to date preflight checklist can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Am8eFzuuixUELpMiEJh-YBFtG56V5DcAw-WyyR8btWU/edit#gid=0).

To inflate the balloon, we had purchased a regulator and adapter for our gas tank. While the inflation process is simple, measuring the lift of the balloon is trickier. We had a lower resolution scale to measure the lift, but did not want to detach the balloon from the filling hose. Since the hose was still attached when taking measurements, we knew the lift would be underestimated. This was acceptable since our predicted flight path allowed for overinflation (which would lead to a shorter flight). In the end, we used a combination of the scale to ballpark our lift, and fine tuned the final inflation by attaching the payload, adding roughly 150 grams of weight to it, supporting the inflation hoes as best we could, and stopping inflation once the payload began lifting off the ground. Our hope was this would give us our target of 200 grams of lift. It ended up being slightly more than that, leading to a shorter flight. For future launches, less weight will be added.
